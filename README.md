# product_recognition_on_store_shelves

In this project, computer vision techniques are implemented in order to perform object detection.
Specifically, the aim is to implement a program for product recognition on store shelves. The aim is to
recognise boxes of cereals of different brands located on the store shelves, and, respectively, their position
and the number of instances of the same boxes appearing in the scenario. The solution proposed is implemented in OpenCV
